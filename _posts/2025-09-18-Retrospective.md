**Start Doing:**

- Felt like tickets were left quite last minute so theres not much time to properly review before sprint ends

**Stop Doing:**

-Stop pushing past our meeting allocated time, we get off topic and discuss non meeting related topics

**Continue Doing:**

-The fact that we have communication in between meetings ensures that no one is waiting for assistance or feedback.

-That if both members do not have anything significant to report the daily standup meeting could be voided
