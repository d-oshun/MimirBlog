We had an intial meeting to discuss the probabaility of partnering for the 4th year project and the potential idea for the project. After a brainstorming session, we decided on a smart wardrobe mirror.

The initial concept for Mimir is a mirror that does more than just reflect; it will help users plan their outfits, visualize clothing items digitally, and integrate with their calendar and weather forecasts to suggest appropriate attire.

Before committing, we conducted preliminary research to gauge the feasibility of the idea. The initial signs are promising, and we believe there's a genuine market for a product that simplifies the daily routine of choosing an outfit.

To manage the project effectively we established the programmes we would use to manage infomation:

- Created a Discord channel for day-to-day communication and quick meetings.

- Set up a Jira board to track our tasks, stories, and bugs.

- Provisioned a temporary GitHub repository to host our code and documentation.
