We successfully held our first meeting with Dr. Robin Nie today, she has agreed to be our official supervisor for the 4th year project

The meeting was incredibly productive. Dr. Nie reviewed our proposal and provided valuable, actionable feedback:
<!--more-->
-She advised us to expand our competitor research from 3 to 5 companies and, crucially, to look into the Chinese market for smart mirrors and fashion tech, as it is a leading innovator in this space.

-She also encouraged us to begin work on the detailed Functional Specification document immediately, noting that it will be the blueprint for our entire development process.
