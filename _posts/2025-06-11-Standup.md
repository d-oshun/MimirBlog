We held our final meeting before taking a small break. All tasks in the current sprint were completed, reviewed, and approved. We've made good progress on the Functional Specification.

After a unanimous decision, the team will be taking a short, well-deserved break to focus on our internships over the summer. We will resume our full-time work on Mimir in September.
